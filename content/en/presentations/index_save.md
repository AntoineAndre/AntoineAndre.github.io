## Post-doctoral research

## Ph.D. research

## Master Thesis research

## Softwares

### Vernier Library (2018 -)

The Vernier Library is an open-source C++ library for pose measurement of calibrated patterns with subpixel resolutions.

The library gathers a collection of classes for detection and rendering different kind of calibrated patterns (periodic patterns, megarena patterns, QR-code-like and bitmap patterns).

### LibPeR (2022 -)

## Teaching (2018 - 2021)

Courses given to Master 2 ENSMM students (final year of engineering school).

Practical courses goals:

- Teach the basics of computer vision theory applied to practical cases with 3 separate courses (4h each)
- The courses include the following topics :
  - Camera calibration
  - Homography and patching an image in an other
  - Stereo vision with a triangulation problem
- Courses contains some classic examples of computed vision applications such as panoramic photography, photogrammetry, RANSAC, structure from motion etc. to give the students a glimpse of the panel of possibilities allowed by computer vision.
