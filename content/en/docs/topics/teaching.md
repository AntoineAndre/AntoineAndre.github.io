## Computer vision practical courses (2018 - 2021)

Courses given to Master 2 ENSMM students (final year of engineering school), for a total of 108 hours along the three years of teaching.

### Practical courses goals

- Teach the basics of computer vision theory applied to practical cases with 3 separate courses (4h each)
- The courses include the following topics :
  - Camera calibration
  - Homography and patching an image in an other
  - Stereo vision with a triangulation problem
- Courses contains some classic examples of computed vision applications such as panoramic photography, photogrammetry, RANSAC, structure from motion etc. to give the students a glimpse of the panel of possibilities allowed by computer vision.

## Final year supervisor project in research (Oct. 2019 - Jan. 2020)

Final years ENSMM students have to conduct a research project that lasts for 6 months long. Proposed project was to study the error in the movements of clocks to provide better metrology to calibrate watches and clocks with a high resolution.

This project involved studying basic clock needle movements as preliminary results. To perform this, a high speed camera was used to film a HP Code (HHigh-precision Code fiducial marker) that contains a periodic pattern to provide a highly resolute measure of the needle evolution.

The project was conducted by RaphaÃ«l Joly and Lucas Girerd.

## Microcontrolers practical courses

Courses given to Master 1 ENSMM students (second year of engineering school), for a total of 20 hours.

Goal of given practical courses is to teach how to command and control a microcontroler of the PIC family (PIC16F)
